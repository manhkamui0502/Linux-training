Async read/ write
	#include <aio.h>
	
	struct aiocb cb;
	memset(&cb, 0, sizeof(struct aiocb));
	cb.aio_nbytes = SIZE_TO_READ;
	cb.aio_fildes = file;
	cb.aio_offset = 0;
	cb.aio_buf = buffer;
	
- Sync reda/ write causes program blocked until it done
 => use async or other thread to read/ write.
 
 => after aio_read(&cb) will trigger an other process / thread to execute
